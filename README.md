# This Book is Entirely Made by AI
 
I am publishin a book online. The name of this book is "This book is entirely made by AI" and it lives up to its name! Every word, sentence, and chapter within this book (including the front pages, citations, apendix and cover image) is made by AI (ChatGPT). This book is about sending a message, the message that AI is very capable of doing great and valuable things, and that AI singularity is coming, and in your lifetime.

### How It Was Created

Using ChatGPT, I interacted with the AI to outline, draft, and refine the content you are about to read. From discussing the history and evolution of AI to exploring its current applications and future possibilities, every topic and perspective emerged from dynamic interactions with ChatGPT. Through prompts and feedback, ChatGPT processed vast amounts of information, synthesized ideas, and crafted coherent narrativesâ€”all based on its training on diverse texts and datasets.
